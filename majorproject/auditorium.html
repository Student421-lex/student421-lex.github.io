        <p>The auditorium is pitch black when you enter. You all split up to look around. Some of you go up to the stage and then behind it to explore. And others try to get into the tech room at the top of the auditorium to see what was left behind in there.</p>
        <p>One of the group calls out from behind the stage saying that it looks like they left all the stuff behind from whatever performance the school last put on. You all head back to look through the different set pieces, costumes, and props. Some of the props are tiny pieces that could fit into your pockets and a discussion starts about whether or not any of you want to try to sneak out pieces as a token of the test of courage.</p>

        <p>Do you take a prop and stick it in your pocket or do you just go on with the exploring as your supposed to?</p>
