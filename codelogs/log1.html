	<h1>HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
	<hr>
    <h3>Difference Between Non-Semantic and Semantic Tags</h3>
    <p>The differene between Non-Semantic and Semantic tags are that semantic tags defines the content that is going inside the tags. Such as the tag &ltimg&gt which is the tag for an image. This tag clearly is defining what will be inide it. A non-semantic tag such as &ltdiv&gt doesn't define what could be inside of it.</p>

    <h3>Some Benefits to Using Semantic Tags</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows datat to be shared a reused across different applications and communities</li>
        <li>It allows for better accessibilty to your website</li>
        <li>Your code is much easier to read when using semantics than not</li>
