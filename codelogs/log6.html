	<p>I decided to look up positioning on the four sites.</p>
    
    <h3>Sites I Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XPath/Reference/Functions/position">Mozilla Developer Network</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/">CSS Tricks</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp">W3Schools</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://cssreference.io/positioning/">CSS Reference</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differences</h3>

    <p>One difference that I noticed right off the bat between the sites was that MDN had a more advanced (or at least it felt to me advanced) definition of the position element compared to the other sites. Another thing I noticed was different that in CSS reference it jumped straight into coding example uses for different positioning options.</p>
    <p>A big difference I also noticed was that W3Schools had a try it yourself function after introducing a new positioning aspect. The other sites did not have something like this but they did all show examples along with text explanation.</p>

    <h3>What I Think a Code Reference Page Should Have</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Possible definition of the code</li>
        <li>Examples of Use</li>
        <li>Possible link to further more indepth explanation or examples for those that are more interested than just initial use</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Between the sites I didn't think there was one that was more bad than another. I thought they all explained position and gave good examples of different used of it. I would say that I do think W3Schools is the best out of the four I chose for its try it yourself function.</p>
