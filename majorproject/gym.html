        <p>The path to the gym seems more ominous than the rest of the building you have explored so far. Maybe its just the fact that you are all going some where that you were told not to or it actually is just creepier than the rest that you've seen.</p>
        <p>You slowly walk into the gym and find that floor boards are pulled up and stacked. They were definitly in the middle of updating the floor before they closed the school. Moving the flashlight around the sound of scurrying catches all of yours attention.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="gymChoices">
        <p>Looking at each other you debate whether to investigate the noise or decide that was enough exploring where you shouldn't.</p>
