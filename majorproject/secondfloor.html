		<p>You all slowly walk up the stairwell, watching your steps as you go up. When you reach the top you can see why you were all told to stay off the second floor.</p>
		<p>While there is definitely some spaces that are safe for you all to walk on, you can see that some of the flooring is missing or distorted from some kind water or some other damage to it. It does look like an insteresting puzzle though to get through if you wanted to try.</p>
