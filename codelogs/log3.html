    <h1>CSS Media Query</h1>

    <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
        <p>Media queries work by setting constraints, such as a minimun or max of a width, to which one wants a specific thing to happen. Such as setting the background a website to be purple when the width is wider than 350px but if it is smaller than that having the background change to default white or another color of ones choosing.</p>
    <h3>Why is it Useful?</h3>
        <p>These are useful because it is a way that one can ensure that their site will look the way they want it to depending on a relative size rule that they set.</p>
    <h3>Example Supported Media Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Aspect Ratio</li>
                <p>This allows you to set styles based on the aspect ration of the viewport. An example would be a &lt@media (min-aspect-ratio: 12/9)&gt and then having what you want to have show up or the page look like when its this size.</p>
            <li>Resolution</li>
                <p>With this one you can set a style based on a device's pixel density. An example would look like this &lt@media (min-resolution: 200dpi)&gt.</p>
            <li>Width</li>
                <p>This allows you to set the style based on the width of the viewport. An exampe would look something like &lt@media (width: 250px)&gt.</p>
            <li>Prefers Color Scheme</li>
                <p>This feature is used to look at a person's preferred theme, such as dark or light, and then asign a style that would show up specifically for that theme. It would look somthing like this &lt@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme: dark)&gt and then followed by your choice of website style.</p>
        </ul>
