    <h1>CSS Media Query</h1>

    <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
        <p>Media queries work by setting constraints, such as a minimun or max of a width, to which one wants a specific thing to happen. Such as setting the background a website to be purple when the width is wider than 350px but if it is smaller than that having the background change to default white or another color of ones choosing.</p>
    <h3>Why is it Useful?</h3>
        <p>These are useful because it is a way that one can ensure that their site will look the way they want it to depending on a relative size rule that they set.</p>
