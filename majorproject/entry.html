	<p>It's your groups turn to enter the school. Before entering you are told that the gym was under construction before the school closed and was never finished so you all are not allowed in it. Along with not being allowed in the gym the second floor is off limits to due to structure issues and parts of the floor starting to rot.</p>
    <p>With the rules being explained you are given free reign to enter and explore what is opened to you.</p>
	<p>Your group enters the entry way of the school and see that there are two ways to go. Do you go down the left or the right hallways?</p>
