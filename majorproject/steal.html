        <p>You all decided to take a prop each. After each picking a prop you all continue exploring the rest of the school. You swear that after leaving the auditorium with your prizes that it feels like eyes are following you all. It seems that there are footsteps that don't belong to your group and each of you keeps thinking they hear whispering.</p>
        <p>The rest of the exploring goes on like this and you all convince each other that your just freaking yourselves out because you took stuff that you weren't supposed to. Finishing up you leave and join everyone outside. Getting outside feels like a breath of fresh air and that whatever was freaking you all out is no longer there, even if it was just you guys being paranoid. Discreetly you all show off your prizes to your friends and share what you think you felt and saw.</p>
