            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine yeast with 1 teaspoon of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the warmed milk. Stir together and let rest until puffy and doubled, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, aerate flour before measuring, then spoon into measuring cup and level, placing into large bowl. Whisk in remaining sugar and salt.</li>
                <li>Add remaining evaporated milk, oil, one of the eggs, yeast and butter; stir until blended. Cover with plastic wrap and a clean towel, set aside for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn out onto floured surface and knead by hand for 20 minutes, or until dough is elastic and can be stretched without tearing, or add dough to mixing bowl with dough hook and knead on speed 2 for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add 1 teaspoon of oil to bowl, return dough to bowl, turn to coat, cover with plastic wrap and towel and let rest in a draft free spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Butter a 9 x 13 x 2 inch baking pan and set aside. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 4 times, drawing in flour if too sticky.</li>
                <li>Use rolling pin to roll into a rectangle and fold the sides into the dough, as with biscuits, rolling and folding 4 more times. Roll out to rectangle again, cut dough in half lengthwise, then into 12 equal squares. Shape into balls and place into buttered pan.</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Beat remaining egg and gently brush tops of rolls with beaten egg. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan and transfer to a cooling rack as soon as possible to prevent bottoms from getting soggy.</li>
