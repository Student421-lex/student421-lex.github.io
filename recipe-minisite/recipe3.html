                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt to combine.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed to
                        beat the butter and 1¼ cups sugar until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides
                        and bottom of the mixing bowl. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, and beat until combined,
                        scraping the bowl down as needed. Slowly beat in the flour mixture.</li>
                    <li>Place the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow dish. Using a large (3-tablespoon) spring-loaded
                        scoop, divide the dough into balls, then roll in sugar to coat evenly. Place the dough balls on
                        the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart, and flatten slightly with the bottom of a
                        measuring cup.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies set and begin to brown. Cool for 5 minutes
                        before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies can be stored in an airtight
                        container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
