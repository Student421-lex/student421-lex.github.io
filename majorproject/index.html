		<p>Your senior class has decided that instead of the normal senior prank or ditch day that they would do a test
			of courage by exploring a closed elementary school building nearby that has been left empty for years. The
			senior class council was able to get permission for certain rooms and areas of the school to be explored by
			your classmates for a night. You are to be seperated into groups and go around the building with only
			flashlights to see with. </p>
